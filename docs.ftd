-- ft.page: Using `doc-site` for `FTD` web projects

We at FifthTry designed and developed `FTD` langauge for you. Using our own `FTD`
language `doc-site` is designed for you to create your documentation sites. 
`doc-site` also helps authors, entrepreneurs, corporate groups and bloggers to
create their own web projects using `FTD` language.

This simple and easy documentation will help you to modify or update original `doc-site`
with your own web projects.


--- ft.h2: Editing `index.ftd` & updating default content

`index.ftd` is added by default to your `FTD` `doc-site`. Let's edit its default
content with your new content.

üîè To edit `index.ftd` file click on `index.ftd` file from your `GitHub` repository 
home. `GitHub` will open this file as non-editable. 

To edit `index.ftd` file click on edit icon. Once you click on edit icon 
`index.ftd` file will be opned for editing into `GitHub` live editor.

üëç You can start editing `index.ftd` file with `GitHub` live editor. Use `ds.page` 
syntax to create page for your `FTD` website homepage. e.g. below code:


--- ft.code: Example content for `index.ftd` using `ds.page` syntax:
lang: ftd

\-- ds.page: ‚ú® Design the Ultimate Blog Homepage

For blogs, a user‚Äôs [first impression is key](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/). If visitors can‚Äôt determine [credibility](http://credibility.stanford.edu/), navigate easily or connect with 
the content, they are less likely to subscribe or return.

--- ft.markdown:

The primary job of a blog is to deliver content to a distinct 
audience. In staying true to the topic, the blog must also meet
the challenge of attracting the target reader‚Äôs attention and relate 
to their point of view.

All of these factors are typically handled through design. Naturally, 
the color palette, imagery, logo placement and style most prominently 
communicate a blog‚Äôs personality andtopic. However, the best blogs are 
not the most visually stunning, but the most relevant and functional.

\-- ds.page: My first blog post -- title of the post

Today I started writing my blog using `FTD`. `FTD` language is designed 
and developed by FifthTry Private Ltd. Its a Banglore based start-up company. 

FifthTry Private Ltd. is backed by [Y Combinators](https://www.fifthtry.com/). 
They have designed `FTD` language for all technical and non-technical users. 

I started using `FTD` by following very simple steps given on their [Author Docs](https://fifthtry.github.io/doc-site/docs) tutorial.

I would recommend `FTD` for all authors, entrepreneurs, corporate groups and bloggers.

I find it very simple to use. Just few clicks here and there and you 
are ready with your own `GitHub` live website.

Once you see {ft.greenmarker:green} tick on `pages build and deployment`, it means your `post.ftd`
file is successfully deployed on live website.

To see it live add `post` into your website url. e.g. https://gsalunke.github.io/my-ftd-blog/post/.


--- ft.h2: Creating `config.ftd` & changing `ds.site-name` with `My FTD Blog`

Default value of `ds.site-name` variable is `LOGO`. Let's change it with your 
blog name. e.g. here we will change `LOGO` `site-name` with `My FTD Blog`.

To change default value of `site-name` you need to add `config.ftd` file into `FPM`
folder.

To create `config.ftd` file follow same steps we mentioned in [How to create a new page into `FTD` website?](author-docs/#how-to-create-new-ftd-file) to `Create new file`. As mentioned above `config.ftd` should be created inside `FPM` folder. So to create new folder
simply type folder-name into `Name your file...` input box followed by `/` `GitHub`
will consider `FPM/` as folder and it will create folder named `FPM` into route
directory of your `FTD` repository.

Now provide file name as `config.ftd` and add below code into `config.ftd` file
using `GitHub` live editor.


--- ft.code: Creating `config.ftd` file into `My FTD Blog`
lang: ftd

\-- import: fpm
\-- import: ds

\-- ds.site-name: My FTD Blog

Once you commit `FPM/config.ftd` file, `FPM` builder will start building newly added
files.

Let `FPM` build finish up [pages-build-and-deployment](pages-build-and-deployment) build
process. 

Once you see {ft.greenmarker:green} tick on `pages build and deployment`, it means your `config.ftd`
file is successfully deployed on live website.


--- ft.h2: Udating `config.ftd` into `FPM.ftd` file
id: updating-fpm-ftd-file

Our newly created `FTD` configuration file should be added into `FPM.ftd` file,
otherwise the configurations we mentioned `FPM/config.ftd` file won't work.

To refer `config.ftd` file inside `FPM.ftd` click on `FPM.ftd` file. `GitHub` will
open this file as non-editable. 

To edit `FPM.ftd` file click on edit icon. Once you click on edit icon `FPM.ftd` file
will be opned for editing into `GitHub` live editor.

Add below code into your `FPM.ftd` file.


--- ft.code: Updating `FPM.ftd` file with `config.ftd`
lang: ftd

\-- fpm.auto-import: gsalunke.github.io/my-ftd-blog/FPM/config


--- ft.markdown:

In above example code we have added `config.ftd` file into `gsalunke.github.io/my-ftd-blog/`

So, while linking we should provide full path of `config.ftd` file, as mentioned in above
example.

Follow same steps [commiting-my-first-post-ftd](author-docs/#commiting-my-first-post-ftd) to `commit` `FPM.ftd` file.

--- ft.h2: Using `fpm.sitemap` feature for sections in header
id: fpm-sitemap-feature

FifthTry have developed `fpm.sitemap` for you. Using `fpm.sitemap` feature you 
can add sections and sub-sections into header.

To use `fpm.sitemap` feature, we need to [edit your `FPM.ftd`](author-docs/#updating-fpm-ftd-file) file and add sections, sub-sections into it.


--- ft.code: Using `fpm.sitemap` example code:
lang: ftd

\-- fpm.sitemap:

# Home: index.html

## My Sub Section: /sub-section/

- Sidebar link: /toc-link/
  - Sidebar sub-link: /toc-sublink/

# Sample Post: /post/

--- ft.markdown:

Once you add sitemap links into your `FPM.ftd` file and commit it. `FPM` will auto generate 
`sitemap` for your `FTD` website. 

--- ft.h3: Let's understand above code snippet:

`# Home: index.html` : `#` single hash treated as a section

{ft.yellowmarker:**Home** link will be shown as primary section inside header.}

`## My Sub Section: /sub-section/` : `##` double hash treated as a sub-section

{ft.yellowmarker: **My Sub Section** link will be shown into **Home** page as secondary section below header.}

`- Sidebar link: /toc-link/`  : `-` dash treated as toc-link

{ft.yellowmarker: **Sidebar link** will be shown inside sidebar as table of contents link.}

`  - Sidebar sub-link: /toc-sublink/` : indented `-` dash treated as toc-sub-link

{ft.yellowmarker:**Sidebar sub-link** will be shown as sub-link to **Sidebar link** indented `10px` to it.}

`# Sample Post: /post/` : `#` single hash treated as a section

{ft.yellowmarker:**Sample Post** link will be shown as section inside header.}

Each section or sub-section link will be shown in {green-link: green} color when its active.

{ft.redmarker:***RULE:*** }

Whilte adding links to `fpm.sitemap` `/link-url/` should be a `.ftd` file. e.g. if
you are adding link as `/my-link/` then in your route folder `my-link.ftd` file 
should be present. Similarly if you are adding a link from folder e.g. `/directory/folder-link`
then folder named `directory` should be present in route directory. And inside 
`directory` folder `folder-link.ftd` file should be present.

For example refer our [fpm.dev](https://fpm.dev/) or [ftd.dev](https://ftd.dev/)
websites to learn more about sitemap linking.

--- ft.h1: Using `FTD` components inside `doc-site`

FifthTry has designed many `FTD` components for authors. By following simple 
and easy steps you can use these components into your `FTD` projects.

According to your need you can use these components. [Click here](https://fpm.dev/all)

For example you want to use our [`bling`](https://fifthtry.github.io/bling/) components. 
To use `bling` library you need to add `-- fpm.dependency: fifthtry.github.io/bling` into 
`FPM.ftd` file.


Since `bling` library comes with many components. Visit [bling library demo](https://fifthtry.github.io/bling/index.html) and choose component you are looking for.

Lets say if you are looking for an [`sidenote` component](https://fifthtry.github.io/bling/sidenote/). Which highlights important part of content inside your page.

Watch below video which explains - how to add `FPM` dependencies?
